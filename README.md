# Python-PG
Good day.

This is a basic program written in Python programming Language. It is a random password generator, that creates a 15-character password with letters in lower and upper case, 
numbers, and different symbols. It is based on the Microsoft Guide for a good password.

This program was created for people who are not very tech-savvy and need to create a secure password with minimal effort, this program is not only easy to use but very easy to design
for everybody who wants to make it. 

I hope it is useful, thanks for visiting my profile, any changes you might want to add feel free to make them.
